# Algorithm to backtrack the route function

Start of routePacket function 
function routePacket(fabric, start, goal):
   rows = number of rows in fabric
   cols = number of columns in fabric
   
   visited = 2D array initialized to false
   
   if backtrack(start.row, start.col):
       return true  // valid route found
   else
       return false // no valid route

End of routePacket function


Currently No Good
Re change the nameing of these nodes
If the Node.row.down is Greater than rows OR is Null can be done together
Not is equal to 503 Then

I am calling recursively to check current nodes 
Once they are clear I can move the the next node
dependent on my direction

Start of BackTrack function

	If Node is Greater than rows OR is Null OR Node is equal to 503
		return false
	Else If Node is equal in the Visited Array
	Else If Node is equal to Goal
		return true
	End If

	If the Node.row.left is Less than columns OR is Null OR is equal to 503 Then
		Get Node.row.right
	Else If Node is equal to Goal
		return true
	Else
		Add the Node to the visitors array
		Call the BackTrack function with Node.row and Node.col-1
	End If

	---

	If the Node.row.right is Greater than columns OR is Null OR is equal to 503 Then
		Get Node.row.up
	Else If Node is equal to Goal
		return true
	Else
		Add the Node to the visitors array
		Call the BackTrack function with Node.row and Node.col+1
	End If

	---

	If the Node.row.up is Greater than columns OR is Null OR is equal to 503 Then
		Return False
	Else If Node is equal to Goal
		return true
	Else
		Add the Node to the visitors array
		Call the BackTrack function with Node.row-1 and Node.col
	End If

	---

End of BackTrack function
