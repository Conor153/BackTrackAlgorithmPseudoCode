# Algorithm to backtrack the route function

Start of routePacket function 
function routePacket(fabric, start, goal):
   rows = number of rows in fabric
   cols = number of columns in fabric
   
   visited = 2D array initialized to false
   
   if backtrack(start.row, start.col):
       return true  // valid route found
   else
       return false // no valid route

End of routePacket function


Start of BackTrack function

	//Check that Node is valid

	If Node row is Greater than rows OR the Nodes row is Less than 0 OR Node column is Greater than columns OR the Nodes column is less than 0
		return false
	Else if Node is Null OR Node is equal to 503
		return false
	Else If Node is equal in the Visited Array
		return false
	//Check that Node is our goal
	Else If Node is equal to Goal
		return true
	End If
	
	
	//Mark the node as visited
	Visited[row of the Node][Column of the Node]= true

	//Move through fabric
	//Move downward
	If Call BackTrack function with a Node where row +1 and column stays the same
		return true
	//Move right
	Else If Call backtrack function with a Node where row stays the same and column +1
		return true
	//Move Left
	Else If Call backtrack function with a Node where row stays the same and column -1
		return true
	//Move up
	Else If Call backtrack function with a Node where row -1 and column stays the same
		return true
